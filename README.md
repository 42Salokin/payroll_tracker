# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

This is an application to record a roster of employee first name, last name, and salary, and display that information on a table. It also logs the average employee salary and the winner of the random employee drawing to the console, viewable using Chrome DevTools.

Most of this was starter code that I added to. I made no changes to the CSS. The only change I made to the HTML was connecting the 'Add Employees' button to the Javascript. I added functionality to the JS to make the prompts appear, to log the input from the prompts, and to make the console logs display.

## Credits

I frequently used advice from other developers in my class and Stack Overflow, and the information at W3schools to assist me with putting functions, methods, and properties in proper working order.
